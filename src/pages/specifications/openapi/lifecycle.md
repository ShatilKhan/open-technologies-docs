OpenAPI is best known for being able to generate API documentation, but it is also capable of generating mock servers, tests, security scans, client SDKs, server stubs, and other essential aspects of operating APIs. OpenAPI is much more than just any single end goal of producing a definition for an API, it provides the machine-readable details needed to guide an API forward as part of the API lifecycle. The usage of OpenAPI often depends on how far along an organization and its teams are in their API journey, and usually, it begins in service of documentation, but then will rapidly expand from there to enable other areas of the API lifecycle across organizations. OpenAPI definitions can be created from existing code, either as a one-off process (pivoting to a API design-first workflow) or as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

* **Documentation** - OpenAPI can be used to generate and keep documentation up to date, providing all the details needed to publish human-readable documentation that makes onboarding much easier.
* **Client Code Generation** - OpenAPI can be used to generate code libraries and SDKs in a variety of programming languages, helping produce client or server-side code that makes it easier to work with APIs.
* **Contract Testing** - OpenAPI can be used to generate contract tests, ensuring that every path of an API is fully tested, putting the contract into contract testing, and making sure all contracts are valid.
* **Mocking** - With the surface area of an API defined as a machine-readable OpenAPI, complete with examples for each individual request and response it can then be used to generate mock servers that can be used as part of the API design process, for testing, or supporting other business use cases.
* **Gateway** - Most modern API gateways support the OpenAPI specification, using the contract to deploy and map incoming API requests to their appropriate backend system, integration, or API. This ensures that your production environment and the API contract are always in sync, and properly describing the surface area of each API.

There are many other areas of the API lifecycle that OpenAPI can be used to help improve API operations, but these elements represent the top ways in which the open source specification is being applied across enterprise organizations. OpenAPI will standardize how you document, generate code, test, mock, and deploy APIs to gateways across teams and domains.

## Collaboration

OpenAPI contracts provide a rich opportunity for collaboration across teams, with stakeholders, and consumers, allowing for sharing, publishing, commenting, and other valuable ways for working together, helping make API operations a team sport.

* **Sharing** - OpenAPIs provide teams with a tangible machine-readable way to share a definition for an API using a URL, allowing anyone with access to share links in chats, social media, and other communication channels.
* **Publishing** - It is always recommended that you publish the OpenAPI alongside the documentation you publish for any API, providing both the machine and human-readable definition for an API, allowing consumers to pick what they need.
* **Source Control** - OpenAPI artifacts can be synced to source control, ensuring that the contract for each API is present alongside the code, tests, and other artifacts needed to bring an API to life and maintain it as part of each release.
* **Comments** - An OpenAPI document opens up the opportunity to associate comments and discussion with the overall contract, but more importantly specific elements of that contract, helping make discussions as precise as they possibly can across teams and with consumers.

It is hard to get teams on the same page when it comes to what an API should do. OpenAPI provides a sharable, publishable, and repeatable format that can be used to drive discussions, collaboration, and developers across API operations. Getting your team on the same page and moving in the same direction is the top benefit enterprises see from using OpenAPI.
