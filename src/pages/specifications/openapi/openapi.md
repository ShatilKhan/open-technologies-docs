OpenAPI (formerly known as [Swagger](../history/)) is an open-source specification used for describing HTTP APIs. It provides a machine- and human-readable format for describing the details of requests and responses. This specification establishes a contract that can be used to generate documentation, mock servers, client SDKs and test your API. OpenAPI definitions can also be created from existing API code, using annotations or introspection.

## Purpose

OpenAPI provides an artifact that may be shared, collaborated on and evolved, informing every stakeholder of the capabilities of your API. OpenAPI provides us with a common vocabulary for collectively moving APIs forward at scale in a consistent way, giving us something that both the machines and humans can make sense of. Acknowledging that it takes something to be well defined enough for the computers to get what is happening, but also easy enough for humans to make sense of, allows us to strike a balance and agreement between the machines and humans about what each digital resource and capability will do.

* **Contracts** - OpenAPIs provide a contract that can provide a shared meaning of what an API delivers, helping ensure that API producers and consumers are on the same page.

* **Lifecycle** - OpenAPIs can be used across the API lifecycle, most commonly used for documentation and code generation, but can also be used to automate testing, security, and other aspects of API operations.

* **Communication** - OpenAPI helps ensure API producers and consumers (whether internal or external) are in agreement as to the API's capabilities and have a shared understanding regarding how an API should operate, as well as what it should not be doing.

* **Change** - Machine-readable contracts are how you get a better handle on the change occurring across many APIs. Often [semantic](https://semver.org/) or date-based versioning is used.

## Foundation

The OpenAPI specification is built on a solid open-source foundation, ensuring that the format for describing our APIs is independent of any platform, service, or tooling. OpenAPI has been evolving since it was put into the Linux Foundation in 2015 and enjoys a solid base for growth due to a handful of key ingredients being present.

* **OpenAPI Initiative** - The OpenAPI specification is managed by the OpenAPI Initiative (OAI), providing a Business Governance Board (BGB), Technical Steering Committee (TSC), outreach and event resources, as well as Special Interest Groups (SIGs) to move forward specific areas of the specification and resources for vertical markets. Everyone interested in moving the specification forward is part of the Technical Developer Community (TDC).
* **Linux Foundation** - The OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) operates within the larger [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) (LF), providing a wealth of resources and guidance for the specification, ensuring it lives on and has the support it needs to operate on into the future.
* **Service Providers** - The OpenAPI specification is supported by most commercial API service providers, bringing more interoperability muscle to the specification, and allowing it to be imported, exported, and synced between providers using source control.
* **Tooling** - In addition to commercial service providers, open source tooling makers have also adopted and built their solutions around the OpenAPI specification, providing many low-cost options when it comes to leveraging OpenAPI contracts across the API lifecycle.
* **Adoption** - When you look across the landscape you will see that many top API providers have adopted the OpenAPI specification, with companies like Twilio, Stripe, Twitter, Plaid, GitHub, and others using the format for documentation and code generation as part of their regular operations.

There are many factors at play that have pushed OpenAPI to be the specification of choice when it comes to enterprise organizations putting to work, but these elements provide a base foundation that has brought us to this moment and will continue expanding in coming years. OpenAPI is currently at version 3.1, with active discussion started regarding what version 4.0 might look like, continuing to build on the foundation that has already been laid.
