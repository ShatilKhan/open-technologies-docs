                  <h1>The API lifecycle</h1>
                  <p>
                    The API lifecycle is a common aspect of API operations that every business faces when it comes to delivering APIs. While there are some variances to how teams, companies, and different types of APIs are delivered, most API lifecycles are the same, despite what beliefs are on the ground floor amongst developers. When you ask different teams at different levels within the enterprise you will get many different responses about what the lifecycle is, resulting in misalignment across operations that can reduce velocity and introduce friction on a regular basis.
                  </p>
                  <h2>A common vocabulary</h2>
                  <p>Teams assuming they are on the same page for the stages involved with delivering an API, or each iteration of APIs, is one of the top challenges for organizations. This is why we recommend establishing a common definition for what the API lifecycle is, even if there is dissent amongst ranks around the semantics and details of the definition. A common vocabulary will help stabilize how teams discuss the delivery of APIs, with the underlying definition evolving over time--but you have to start somewhere.</p>

                      <p><strong>Discover</strong> - Consumers will not spend a lot of time looking for new APIs that fit the profile of what they need. Discovering the right API can take hours, days, weeks, or be impossible. Make it easy for your consumers to find APIs by understanding where they already exist, searching, and spending their time, meeting consumers where they are.</p>
